# INTRO
this mod pack is built for minecraft 1.19.4 with quilt.

mods are seaperated into 3 files. mods required for the server only, client only, and mods that are shared across both. the majority of mods are likely to fall under shared.
mods also fall under subcategories. if a new mod easily falls under one of the prexisting categories, it shall simply be placed there.

mods which are not shared are generally optional, and can be safely removed.

feel free to take this as seriously as you'd like. i just like being overly professional. it's fun sometimes.

check out issues for mod suggestions, bugs, and general technical discussion about the modpack.

mods are seaperated into 3 files. mods required for the server only, client only, and mods that are shared across both. the majority of mods are likely to fall under shared. mods also fall under subcategories. if a new mod easily falls under one of the prexisting categories, it shall simply be placed there.

after it's decided that the pack is ready for a release, a zip file will be made of all the mods required for both server and client useage seaperately.

if you would like to directly contribute to the modpack, create a pull request with your desired changes and they will be reviewed as soon as possible.

check out issues for mod suggestions, bugs, and general technical discussion about the modpack.

this mod pack is built for minecraft 1.19.4 with quilt.

mods are seaperated into 3 files. mods required for the server only, client only, and mods that are shared across both. the majority of mods are likely to fall under shared. mods also fall under subcategories. if a new mod easily falls under one of the prexisting categories, it shall simply be placed there.

mods which are not shared are generally optional, and can be safely removed.

mods which have dependancies will be grouped together in a single file. if multiple mods share a dependancy, it will be placed in its respective root folder.

mods which alter how another mod works, such as adding apis, will be placed with its parent.

after it's decided that the pack is ready for a release, a zip file will be made of all the mods required for both server and client useage seaperately.

if you would like to directly contribute to the modpack, create a pull request with your desired changes and they will be reviewed as soon as possible.

final note: this repo is public for convenance and to easily share with friends. if you wish to not have your mod in this pack, please leave an issue or email sweglord227@gmail.com. if we wish to continue useing your mod.

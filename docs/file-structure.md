# File structure

mods are seaperated into 3 files. mods required for the server only, client only, and mods that are shared across both. the majority of mods are likely to fall under shared.
mods also fall under subcategories. if a new mod easily falls under one of the prexisting categories, it shall simply be placed there.

if a mod has a dependancy, it's dependancy will be placed in its own folder along side its dependee. 
if more than one mod shares a dependancy, the dependancy will be placed it a seaperate `lib` folder.

a document containing every mod, and its origin can be found in the root folder.
